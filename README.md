# MacScripts

Scripts for setting up macOS to my liking. Especially system settings with the dock, menu bar and hiding options. 

## uni
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/43castro/macscripts/refs/heads/main/uniMac.sh | bash
```
## maverick 
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/43castro/macscripts/refs/heads/main/maverick.sh | bash

```
