# MacScripts

Scripts for setting up macOS to my liking. Especially system settings with the dock, menu bar and hiding options. 

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/43castro/macscripts/refs/heads/main/uniMac.sh | bash
```



- Removes all default pinned apps
- Pinnes all the apps that I want from the array 
- Enables dock automatic hiding 
- Makes the menu bar hiding automatically
